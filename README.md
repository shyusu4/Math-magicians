## Reflection 

Initially, this application consisted of three pages: a home page displaying random lorem ipsum text, a calculator page, and a page with a quote. While it was as a valuable practice exercise, I decided to simplify it to solely focus on the calculator functionality. This change made more sense to me, considering that users typically require a calculator more frequently.
